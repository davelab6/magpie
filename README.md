magpie
======

A Github Project Management Extension for Google Apps

####Introduction
Magpie is built on three layers:
- A jQuery-like Google App Script library that allows easy access to Google spreadsheets and their cells
- A convenient Javascript wrapper over the Github API that can be used from within Google App Script
- The actual Magpie application, which fetches Github data every hour and renders a dashboard and other reports for your Github project
